# Structs and Classes Lab - 2


## Question 1

Using the Room struct below, write code that demonstrates that it is a value type.

```swift
struct Room {
let maxOccupancy: Int
let length: Double
let width: Double
}

var someRoom = Room.init(maxOccupancy: 234, length: 2.0, width: 2.0)
var anotherRoom = someRoom

someRoom = Room.init(maxOccupancy: 45, length: 2.0, width: 1.0)
print(anotherRoom)

```

## Question 2

Using the Bike class below, write code that demonstrates that it is a reference type.

```swift
class Bike {
var wheelNumber = 2
var hasBell = false
}

var myBike = Bike()
var stolenBike = myBike
myBike.hasBell = true

print(stolenBike.hasBell)
```

## Question 3

a. Given the Animal class below, create a Bird subclass with a new `canFly` property.

```swift
class Animal {
var name: String = ""

init(name: String) {
self.name = name
}

func printDescription() {
print("I am an animal named \(name)")
}
}

class Bird: Animal {
var canFly: Bool

init(canfly: Bool, name: String) {
self.canFly = canfly
super.init(name: name)
}
//b. Override the printDescription method to have the instance of the Bird object print out its name and whether it can fly
override func printDescription() {
if canFly == true {
print("I am an animal named \(name), and I can fly")
} else {
print("I am an animal named \(name) and I'm grounded")
}
}
}

var penguin = Bird.init(canfly: false, name: "Penguin")
penguin.printDescription()
```



## Question 4

```swift
class Bike4 {
let wheelNumber = 2
let wheelWidth = 1.3
var hasBell = true

func ringBell() {
if hasBell {
print("Ring!")
}
}
}

class LoudBike:Bike4 {

//a. Create a `LoudBike` subclass of Bike.  When you call `ringBell` it should ring the bell in all caps.
override func ringBell() {
print("RING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!")
}


//b. Give `LoudBike` a new method called `ringBell(times:)` that rings the bell a given number of times
func ringBell(times: Int) {
for _ in 1...times {
print("RING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!")
}
}
}

var myStolenBike = LoudBike.init()
myStolenBike.ringBell(times: 2)
```


## Question 5

```swift
class Shape {
    var name: String { return "This is a generic shape" }
    var area: Double { fatalError("Subclasses must override the area") }
    var perimeter: Double { fatalError("Subclasses must override the perimeter") }
}
```

a. Given the `Shape` object above, create a subclass `Square` with a property `sideLength` with a default value of 5.

b. Override the `area` and `perimeter` computed values so the return the area/perimeter of the square as appropriate

c. Override the `name` property of `Square` so that it returns a String containing its name ("Square") and its area and perimeter

d. Create a class `Rectangle` that subclasses from `Shape`.  Give it a `width` property with a default value of 6 and a `height` property with a default value of 4

e. Override the `name` property of `Rectangle` so that it returns a String containing its name ("Rectangle") and its area and perimeter.

```swift

class Shape {
var name: String { return "This is a generic shape" }
var area: Double { fatalError("Subclasses must override the area") }
var perimeter: Double { fatalError("Subclasses must override the perimeter") }
}
//a. Given the `Shape` object above, create a subclass `Square` with a property `sideLength` with a default value of 5.

class Square: Shape {
var sideLength = 5

//b. Override the `area` and `perimeter` computed values so the return the area/perimeter of the square as appropriate
override var area: Double {
get {
return Double(sideLength) * Double(sideLength)
}
}

override var perimeter: Double{
get {
return Double(sideLength) * 4
}
}
//    c. Override the `name` property of `Square` so that it returns a String containing its name ("Square") and its area and perimeter

override var name: String {
get {
return "Hey, I'm a square, and my area is \(area), and my perimeter is \(perimeter)."
}
}
}

var myFavoriteShape = Square.init()

myFavoriteShape.name

//d. Create a class `Rectangle` that subclasses from `Shape`.  Give it a `width` property with a default value of 6 and a `height` property with a default value of 4

class Rectangle: Shape {
var width = 6
var height = 4

override var area: Double {
get {
return Double(width) * Double(height)
}
}

override var perimeter: Double {
get {
return Double(width * 2) + Double(height * 2)
}
}
// e. Override the `name` property of `Rectangle` so that it returns a String containing its name ("Rectangle") and its area and perimeter.
override var name: String {
get {
return "Hey, I'm a rectangle I'm cool, and my area is \(area), and my perimeter is \(perimeter)."
}
}
}

var rectanglesAreCool = Rectangle.init()

rectanglesAreCool.name

```
f. (BONUS) What happens when you run the code below?  Explain why.
```swift
var myShapes = [Shape]()

myShapes.append(Square())
myShapes.append(Rectangle())

for shape in myShapes {
    print("This is a \(shape.name) with an area of \(shape.area) and a perimeter of \(shape.perimeter)")
}

**** it's going to print tice because there are only two elements in my array
```

## Question 6

a. Given the Point object below, complete the `distance` method so that it returns the distance between a given point.

The equation for the distance formula can be found [here](https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/distance-2-points.html) and is give by:

```swift
let horizontalDistance = pointOneXValue - pointTwoXValue
let verticalDistance = pointOneYValue - pointTwoYValue
let distanceBetweenTwoPoints = sqrt(horizontalDistance * horizontalDistance + verticalDistance * verticalDistance)
```

`sqrt` is a method in Swift that gives the square root.  Make sure to have `import Foundation` or `import UIKit` to use this method.

```swift
struct Point {
    let x: Double
    let y: Double
    func distance(to point: Point) -> Double {
      //Code in your answer here
    }
}

let pointOne = Point(x: 0, y: 0)
let pointTwo = Point(x: 10, y: 10)

print(pointOne.distance(to: pointTwo)) //Prints 14.142135623730951
```


b. Given the above Point object, and Circle object below, add a `contains` method that returns whether or not a given point is on the circle

```swift
struct Circle {
    let radius: Double
    let center: Point
}

let pointOne = Point(x: 0, y: 0)
let circleOne = Circle(radius: 5, center: pointOne)
let pointTwo = Point(x: 5, y: 0)
let pointThree = Point(x: 4, y: 0)
let pointFour = Point(x: sqrt(12.5), y: sqrt(12.5))
circleOne.contains(pointTwo) //true
circleOne.contains(pointThree) // false
circleOne.contains(pointFour) //true
```

c. Add another method to `Circle` that returns a random point on the circle

Hint: Given the radius of a circle and the x value of a point on the circle, the y value of the point is defined by:

```
âˆš(r^2) - (x^2)
```

```swift
circleOne.contains(circleOne.getRandomPoint()) //Should always be true
```


## Question 7

a. Create a struct called HangmanModel with 3 properties `targetWord: String`, `numberOfIncorrectGuesses: Int` and `guessedLetters: [Character]`.

b. Add a method called `playerWon` that returns whether all of the characters in `targetWord` are in `guessedLetters`

```swift
var model = HangmanModel()
model.targetWord = "hello"
model.guessedLetters = ["h","e","o","l"]
model.playerWon //true
```

c. Add a method called `printDisplayVersionOfWord` that prints the `targetWord` replacing characters that are not in `guessedLetters` with "\_"

```
var model = HangmanModel()
model.targetWord = "hello"
model.guessedLetters = ["h","l"]
model.printDisplayVersionOfWord
//prints h_ll_
```

d. Add a method called `guess(_:)` that takes in a character as input, and updates `guessedLetters` and `numberOfIncorrectGuesses` as appropriate.

```swift
var model = HangmanModel()
model.targetWord = "hello"
model.guess("h")
model.guess("a")
model.guessedLetters // ["h", "a"]
model.numberOfIncorrectGuesses // 1
```

e. Have `guess(_:)` also print out the current display version of the word, the number of incorrect guesses and if the player has won.
